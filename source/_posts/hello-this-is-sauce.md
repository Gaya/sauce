In an effort to start writing more about the DIY stuff I do and any other nonsense which comes to
mind I brushed off this little site I made earlier and gave it a face-lift.

This is a recycle of what I previously called "Wreckey's", a site where I posted my instrument / 
MIDI related project, but as I am working on all different thing and don't want to have a thousand
websites I thought I'd make this low barrier blog.

## What about your other blog?

My "main" blog which I wrote for in my junior years as a developer has not gotten a lot of attention
from me because frankly I do not really like writing in such formats anymore. The subjects do not
really interest me a lot anymore as well. I hope this little blog will make me write random stuff
more often.

## What to expect

Expect music related topics. DIY projects I am working on. Just random thoughts. All sort of things.
I just want to write more.
