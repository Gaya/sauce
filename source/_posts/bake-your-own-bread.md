The last couple of months we've been baking our own sourdough bread at home. I feel like am a little late to the party as all millennials started baking bread at home around that time when we weren't allowed to leave our homes, but they were on to something!

## Make your own food

To bake your own bread is very rewarding and it tastes great. Not only do you know exactly what goes in, you can influence what goes in to meet your standards.

It blew my mind to find out how easy it was to start baking our own bread. The reward of taking your own freshly baked bread out of the oven is great too.

We've been making all sorts of things we used to buy in the supermarket before ourselves like kimchi, kombucha, and ginger beer.

## Start fermenting

Fermentation is a great way to preserve food, but more over it's a great way to add taste to your food. And the only thing you need to do is wait.

I suggested picking something fermented you want to make and try it out. I'd say ginger beer and fermented cabbages (kimchi / sauerkraut) are great places to start.

## Take back control

Nowadays people are more likely to go for the easy route when it comes to preparing food and I feel like we've become disconnected with the food me consume.

Actually taking the time to prepare our food instead of ordering online / buying off the shelf food rewards you with a much better experience.

Of course, you need to learn how to cook, but as with everything: practise improves the outcome.
